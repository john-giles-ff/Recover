# Introduction 
The Recover:LFT Application is the UI Software for Recover:LFT machine. The software assumes it's hardware.

# Getting Started
The application should be flashed onto the board using an ST-Link. The ST-Link Utility Software can be found [here](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link004.html). 

The software is dependant on the TouchGFX framework. A licence has been purchased for a maximum of 1000 Units per/annum. If we exceed this, we'll have to purchase a larger licence.
