# Introduction 
This is a production tool to allow them to quickly view and identify logs that do not conform to guidelines set. 

# Information
This code was originally written by Aric (A summer work student at the time) and due to his lack of C# and WPF knowledge, it's a little rough around the edges. I'll clean it as I go but since it is a fairly simplistic and quick application for internal use only I highly doubt there will be too much development on this project.

# Dendencies
This code heavily relies on [LvCharts](https://github.com/Live-Charts/Live-Charts) for it's graphing tools. Even though we don't distrobute this software this is supplied under the [MIT](https://github.com/Live-Charts/Live-Charts/blob/master/LICENSE.TXT) license
